# Data Scientist Intern Task:1

Welcome to the Data Scientist Intern Task repository! This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization using Python. Below you'll find an overview of the project, the tech stack used, and instructions on how to set it up and run it on your local system.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze a dataset containing player statistics. Key objectives included:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and standardizing column names.
- **Data Transformation**: Normalizing data and creating new metrics.
- **Analysis**: Identifying top performers based on a combined score of multiple metrics.
- **Visualization**: Generating visualizations to better understand the data.
