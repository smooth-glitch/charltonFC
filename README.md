# Data Scientist Intern Task

Welcome to the Data Scientist Intern Task repository! This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization using Python. Below you'll find an overview of the project, the tech stack used, and instructions on how to set it up and run it on your local system.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze a dataset containing player statistics. Key objectives included:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and standardizing column names.
- **Data Transformation**: Normalizing data and creating new metrics.
- **Analysis**: Identifying top performers based on a combined score of multiple metrics.
- **Visualization**: Generating visualizations to better understand the data.

## Tech Stack

The following technologies and libraries were used in this project:

- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and scripting.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting and visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Standardization and proceesing of data using AI algorithms.

## Timeframe

This project was completed over a period of **2 weeks**, including the following phases:

- **Week 1**: Data exploration, cleaning, and transformation.
- **Week 2**: Data analysis, visualization, and documentation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

DataScientistInternTask/ │ ├── data/ # Directory for storing data files │ └── DataScientistInternTask.csv # Original dataset │ ├── src/ # Source code directory │ ├── init.py # Initializes the package │ ├── data_preprocessing.py # Functions for data cleaning and preparation │ ├── analysis.py # Functions for data analysis │ └── visualization.py # Functions for data visualization │ ├── main.py # Main script to run the analysis ├── requirements.txt # List of dependencies └── README.md # Project documentation

## Setup Instructions

To set up this project on your local system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/smooth-glitch/charltonFC.git
   cd DataScientistInternTask
2.**Create a Virtual Environment**:
  python -m venv venv
  
3.**Activate the Virtual Environment**:

    Windows:
        venv\Scripts\activate

    macOS/Linux:
        source venv/bin/activate


4.**Install Dependencies**:
    pip install -r requirements.txt


5.**Run the Main Script**:
    python main.py

Ensure that the dataset (DataScientistInternTask.csv) is located in the data/ directory.

**Dataset**
Due to the large size of the dataset, it is not included in this repository. You can download it from Google Drive. Place the file in the data/ directory to run the analysis.
this is the G-drive link for the dataset : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kb0ivHsLaKdVb1jZkwyuIYYzQewu0dmn/view?usp=drive_link
